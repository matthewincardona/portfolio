					<strong> Reasons to use the platform: </strong>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>building a community and ability to get points of contact</li>
					<li>professional development</li>
					<li>knowledge exchange</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					This is for organizations that are doing projects that support education systems in
					countries. These can be orgs who have been working on SBC4E for a long time or those who
					are just getting introduced to it and need somewhere to start. Our goal is to be a
					knowledge repository that centralizes a lot of this important information and makes it
					easy to search through and discover new content. It will be an open area for the
					dissemination of information; a robust and valuable platform that encourages users to keep
					contributing and others to continue discovering.

					Forking or having an events calendar could be a great feature to have, but wasn't a must

			<h4>Research Analysis</h4>
			<p>
				Before analyzing the survey results, itâ€™s important to look at the verbal feedback I was
				given.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong> Visuals: </strong>
				In my initial tests, despite how lively the very playful and colorful design looked to me, people
				preferred the more blue one. They often said that it was easier to follow and more obvious where
				they were supposed to be looking, eg. the hierarchy was stronger. The very gray and simple design
				was given points for simplicity, but people with more of a designerâ€™s eye were not too interested
				in scrolling through gray boxes all day, nor could they see themselves using this version for
				long periods of time.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong> Content: </strong>
				It was no surprise to me that people tended to favor the more information dense version of the
				resource cards. They felt like they were missing out on important information with the less detailed
				ones and that the design was taking precedence over the content. They also thought it would make
				searching through a long list of cards much harder, as you would have to open them more frequently
				in order to find the right ones.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong> Survey results: </strong>
				Some of it was focused on missing elements in the prototype. Things such as missing the navbar
				on the top of every page or missing the ability to view an organizationâ€™s profile (which is a
				great idea and something that should be included in a future iteration, but is not part of the
				original task flow). Besides the navbar issue, the participants had no problems getting around
				the site. They reported that everything was clear and easy to get to. When creating the prototype
				I made sure to include multiple ways to complete the same task, such as being able to filter
				by topic by either using the filter dropdown or by clicking on the tag in a card. Someone had
				mentioned that the colors might be difficult for certain people to see, so I made slight adjustments
				to the contrast and checked it using an accessibility checker. Someone else was thinking ahead
				to when thereâ€™s going to be a lot more resources, suggesting that each card could use even more
				info and potentially a preview window. Although this might be a great future idea, for now this
				is essentially all of the information available for each card and it shows exactly what the user
				needs to see for how few items there currently are.
