					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>
						During my time at <b>Peraton</b>, I worked with a small team to transform the company's
						fragmented knowledge base, consolidating thousands of critical internal documents spread
						across multiple heritage companies.
						<br /><br />
						Employees relied on this system for government contract applications and daily operations,
						yet it was difficult to search and maintain. Our goal was to create a structured, intuitive
						system that simplified access and encouraged engagement.

				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>
					Peraton's rapid growth through acquisitions makes maintaining an up-to-date database
					challenging. Information is often missing, outdated, or lacks proper points of contact.
					Employees frequently keep documents on personal devices or share them informally, and
					uploaded files are often unsearchable.
					<br /><br />
					The existing knowledge base was a disorganized collection of thousands of documents, making
					it difficult to find or update information. Our goal was to build a system that allows employees
					to easily access and contribute valuable knowledge.

		<h3>Key Insights</h3>
		<p>
			We conducted user interviews with employees at Peraton to gather insights on their experiences
			with the existing knowledge base. The feedback highlighted several key issues:
			<br /><br />
			- The knowledge base was difficult to navigate and search, leading to frustration and inefficiency.
			<br />
			- Employees were less motivated to update the knowledge base because they felt it was underutilized.
			<br />
			- Information was often siloed, making it hard to get a comprehensive view of the company's knowledge.
			<br />
			- It was difficult to quickly identify relevent documents from search results and then pull out
			relevant info from them.
			<br />
			- There was a need for a more user-friendly interface and better search functionality.

		<h3>Requirements Brainstorming</h3>
		<p>
			We took the information we gathered from our interviews and conversations with stakeholders
			and started to brainstorm requirements for the new system.

		<h2 class="case-study__section-title">Personas & Features</h2>
		<p>Based on the information gathered from our interviews, we created the following personas.</p>

		<img class="case-study__img" src={userPersona2} alt="" loading="lazy" />

		<br /><br />
		<p>
			This further helped us to create a potential list of features, which we would later refine
			through more interviews and feedback. It included:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Home Page</li>
			<li>Industry trends - Customized per user</li>
			<li>Recent content</li>
			<li>Search bar</li>
			<li>Filters (take the ones from PKX)</li>
			<li>Contribute Info Button (TBD)</li>
			<li>Upload Documents Page</li>
			<li>Search Results Page</li>

				<li>Breadcrumbs</li>
				<li>Displays results of a search/filter</li>
				<li>See how old/new each item is</li>
				<li>Report & request missing information button</li>

			<li>Individual Search Result</li>

				<li>Author, date, title, brief description, accuracy rating</li>

		<h2 class="case-study__section-title">Prototypes</h2>
		<p>
			From there, we boiled down our features list to just a few items that we wanted to focus on
			and created a prototype to present to our stakeholders.
		</p>
		<br />

		<p><strong>Showcased Features:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Search dropdown for more nuances searches</li>
			<li>Filter by date range</li>
			<li>Feedback and copy buttons</li>
			<li>Content pagination</li>
			<li>View counter</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			We also explored AI-enabled ideas to see what a far-future version of the system could look
			like. We modeled it after ChatGPT's UI and AI search result UIs from browsers like Brave. This
			kind of system would sit next to the new proposed UI as a separate feature and would allow
			users to quickly search for specific points of interest across multiple documents.

	<!-- Future Plans -->
	<section>
		<h2 class="case-study__section-title">Reflection</h2>
		<p>
			Our redesign transformed Peraton’s outdated knowledge base into an intuitive, searchable
			system with improved document organization and discoverability.
			<br /><br />
			However, key challenges emerged that offer opportunities for further refinement:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>Driving Adoption:</b> Despite improved usability, some employees hesitated to contribute.
				Future iterations could incorporate onboarding tutorials and incentives to encourage participation.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Iterative Testing:</b> Additional user testing throughout development would have surfaced
				pain points earlier. A phased rollout with real-time analytics could provide continuous feedback.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Search Optimization:</b> Inconsistent metadata made finding specific documents challenging.
				AI-driven tagging and metadata standardization could improve search accuracy.
			</li>
		</ol>
