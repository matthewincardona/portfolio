                  Second Desk is a <b>Desktop-As-A-Service product</b> that
                  enables non-Windows users to stream Windows programs directly
                  through their browser.

                  This project will provide a solution for Chromebook
                  and Linux users that can’t run work/school required
                  Windows programs on their personal computers.

              <p>
                With the massive growth of Chromebooks in recent years, particularly in the field of education, more and
                more students are using them to do their schoolwork. But after realizing how limiting a Chromebook’s app
                library can be, a lot of them end up frustrated and with very few options.
                <br /> <br />
                I started Second Desk as a way to provide Chromebook users with a more robust computing experience,
                without having to purchase a new Windows or Mac machine. We’re focusing on a niche target audience with
                a specific problem to fix.

            <h4>Competitive Positioning Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              To understand our place in this growing market, we compared ourselves to a variety of Desktop-As-A-Service
              (DAAS) products ranging from enterprise-focused offerings to more consumer-grade ones.
              We found that there were very few companies who had products that both catered to individual consumers and
              offered a relatively low price point.

                At the moment, we’re still in the customer discovery phase. Our current concept of an MVP is subject to
                change as we continue learning more about the problems about users face. That said, we believe a
                potential solution is to stream a remote Windows server and its applications directly through the user’s
                browser. This approach has both pros and cons when compared to a common existing solution:

                <img class="case-study__img" src="./assets/second-desk/product offering.png" alt="" loading="lazy">
              </div>
              <p>After comparing these two approaches, we felt that ours did an excellent job of addressing our user’s
                issues, mainly a low price point and high ease-of-use. Because requiring a decent internet connection
                could be a challenge to some users, it will be an important area to test while we build our MVP.</p>

            <h4>Empathy Interviews</h4>
            <p>
              Being the only UX Designer on the team, it was my responsibility to establish a <b>user-centric approach</b> in my team. 
              I used a few methods, which you can see below, to help put them in our audience's shoes.   <br /><br />
              First and foremost, it was important to conduct interviews and collect data to work from, so we could have an idea of where to start. 
              I wanted to understand common challenges our target audience faced while
              working on their computer(s); these were the questions I asked and the criteria used for participants:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>What is your occupation/major?</li>
              <li>How old are you?</li>
              <li>What is your current computer situation? Do you own one or do you share\lease?</li>
              <li>What do you regularly use it for? (school, work, personal; where do you use it; what apps do you
                typically run)</li>
              <li>What challenges do you face while using a computer? How does this make you feel?</li>
              <li>Is there any way in which you feel these challenges could be resolved? Is there anything stopping you
                from solving these challenges yourself?</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>Target participant characteristics:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ages 12-24</li>
              <li>High school and college students</li>
              <li>Mainly Chromebook users</li>
              <li>Include participants of different majors</li>
              <li>Include participants of different genders</li>

                These are the first personas that were made from the data we gathered. Of course, as we are constantly conducting more interviews and
                revising our work, updates will be made when new content is available.
              
              <br /><br />
              We found that our interviewees were were often more creative-focused in terms of current/preferred major, were on tight budgets and couldn't afford a more expensive Mac or PC, and were frustrated at having to switch between devices to get their work done.

            <h4>Empathy Maps</h4>
            <p>In order to gain a deeper understanding with our users and really connect with them, I created empathy maps. 
              It was an effective way to, for lack of a better word, create empathy in my team, none of whom had ever seen this kind of thing before. 
              Unlike the user personas, which focused more on the black-and-white needs of our users, these were more helpful for understanding people's general emotions and what they were thinking.</p>

            <h4>MVP</h4>
            <p>
              There are two main components to our product: the website and the remote servers. To get a working MVP
              going, we need to allow access to a remote desktop session directly through our website.
              <br /><br />
              Our initial builds used a Windows 2019 EC2 instance from AWS and an in-browser remote desktop client
              called Myrtille. With it, we could access both remote applications like Inkscape and the full desktop of
              our server without ever needing a user download. We eventually constructed a React-based website that
              could connect users to specific programs and even offered a small library of downloaded apps to run.

              <h4>Future Improvements</h4>
              <p>While testing our MVP, there were several roadblocks that we kept facing:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Our remote desktop software was designed for simple office programs, not graphics-intensive ones. Low
                  stream quality and low FPS was sometimes an issue.
                </li>
                <li>The AWS instance lacked a dedicated GPU, bottlenecking the performance of some programs.</li>
              </ul>
              <br /><br />
              <p>
                Finding new remote desktop software was our main prirority, so after researching the stacks behind cloud
                gaming services like Google Stadia (who excelled at remote app streaming), we found that a WebRTC-based
                approach looked the most promising. Althought, we are still in the process of looking for ways to
                improve performance on the server itself.

              Going into this project, I had little familiarity with UX principles, server management, or coding for the
              web. I was the only product developer and designer working on it for a number of months, which forced me
              to learn how to do everything from the ground up. I’ve made a lot of progress since starting and I’m
              continuing to learn more as the project keeps evolving.
