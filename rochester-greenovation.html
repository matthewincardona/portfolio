                  This project was part of a UX competition hosted by the Rochester Institute of Technology. It’s a
                  two-week event that brings students in touch with real clients and challenges them to create an app or
                  website that fulfills the user’s needs. All of the design choices and overall approach is left up to
                  the students.

              <p>
                I chose to work with the local thrift store Rochester Greenovation because of their unique value
                proposition to keep
                waste out of landfills and reuse old items. I worked alongside 3 other teammates who all came from
                different
                backgrounds in UI/UX.

            <ul>
              <li>We talked back and forth with Rochester Greenovation so we could better understand what their biggest
                issues were and what would and wouldn't work for them.</li>
              <li>Researched other eCommerce platforms, including more general ones such as Walmart and more thrift
                store style apps like OfferUp. This gave us a number of useful ideas,
                such as:
                <ul>
                  <li>Popular eCommerce layouts and features we can use (such as a search feature with filters and a
                    featured items section)</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Looked at Greenovation’s social media presence and how much they use each platform. Asked about
                which platforms they preferred to use and which they wanted to continuing using in the future</li>

                <li>
                  Give volunteers an easy way to manage and update inventory, including taking pictures of new stock and
                  adding them to the database
                </li>
                <li>Create a system where customers can review items and provide feedback
                </li>
                <li>Provide a way for Greenovation to communicate store closings and other information with customers
                  and
                  volunteers</li>

                We wanted to show off how much Greenovation has helped their local community. When they first log on,
                users are shown, approximately, how much waste Greenovation has saved from going into landfills.

                Inventory management was an important feature for the client, so we decided to have an account system
                that would track purchases. It can be used to validate purchases and make sure reviews are given by the
                person who actually bought the item.

            <h4>Future Improvements</h4>
            <p>
              To really show that Greenovation is dedicated to helping the environvment, we had considered making a
              gamification
              system that encouraged users to save waste. Shoppers would see a "Green Score" next to every item, which
              shows them approximately how much waste purchasing the item would save. There was also room for tiering
              systems and other traditional gamification elements. Although we had wanted to explore this concept
              further, it was too close to the competition deadline and just couldn't be prioritized.
